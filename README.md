[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v10.4 and above (whatever one has bigint support)

(**Windows Users**) [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) A handy bash terminal, **install in Program Files/Git**

(**Windows Users**) [Download STM32 Virtual COM PORT driver from Goldshell](https://github.com/goldshellminer/HS1/tree/master/miner/serial_driver) OR [Download STM32 Virtual COM PORT driver from STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32102.html)

Linux: Dependencies install can be found in [./linux_installation.md](./linux_installation.md)

(optional) [Docker](#dockerReminders) if you want to run your own fullnode to mine to with the provided utilities



## INSTALLATION

#### Download & Install the Prebuilt ZIP :

[Download Latest from Releases](https://github.com/HandyMiner/HandyMiner-Goldshell-CLI/releases)

**Note: un-zipping the full contents may take a bit.**

#### OR BUILD YOURSELF 

#### Build on the Command Line (mac/linux/windows) :

```npm install``` in this directory or 

#### Windows (non-prebuilt only install) : 

double-click ```install.windows.bat``` (and make sure to run this as administrator). Windows: This will probably take 10 minutes to build.

Windows folks: If you didnt double click ```install.windows.bat``` youll need to run the following commands in the repo root: 
```npm install```

<a id="running"></a>
## THE POINT

First, make sure to plug AC power into the Goldshell HS1 and connect the USB from the HS1 to your computer. 

Non-terminal users: simply double click ```(windows) dashboard.windows.bat``` or ```(mac) dashboard.mac.command``` or ```(linux) dashboard.sh``` files.

**Note:** The first time you launch will run you thru the [miner configurator](#minerConfigurator).

Launch the miner in terminal **in a bash terminal (windows: git-bash)** like:
```
cd (into the repo base)
npm start (runs the CLI miner)

Most terminals:
npm run dashboard //runs the CLI dashboard+miner
OR
./dashboard.sh //same

Note: many windows terminals dont do text coloring or dashboards right with npm run commands.. So if it's an issue (and you didnt double click) you can launch the proper dashboard like:

node --max-old-space-size=8196 ./miner/dashboard.js
```
#### Linux Users note:

To have this app talk to the goldshell serial devices out of the box, you may have to run with ```sudo``` (we did in ubuntu, but not raspi). If you run ```node mine.js``` and run into errors: To grant permissions to your user to talk to the devices without sudo, perform the steps in the [Linux FAQ](#linuxFAQ)

#### Mine blocks!

(Ctrl+C, Q, or ESC to stop the dashboard miner)

<a id="minerConfigurator"></a>
## MINER CONFIGURATOR

The first time you run the miner, you will run through a configurator which will write a config to ./goldshell.json. Should you want to reconfigure in the future, you can just run ```node configure.js``` in this directory. Alternately delete goldshell.json and (re)start the miner.

Required items to have ready for configuration:

0. Host or IP address of the pool or solo node you mine to (127.0.0.1 for your local fullnode)
1. (Pool mining) Your wallet or registered pool username
Optional configuration items (just leave blank and hit enter if you dont know) :
2. Pool or solo node port (probably 3008)
3. The stratum password (optional)

<a id="poolParameters"></a>
## POOL SETTINGS

#### DXPOOL

**stratum host**: hns.ss.dxpool.com
**stratum port**: 3008

**username**: registered_username.workerName
**password**: anything

#### F2POOL

#### 6block

**stratum host**: handshake.6block.com
**stratum_port**: 7701

**username**: username.workerName

**stratum_port**: 3355

**username**: wallet.workerName
**password**: anything

#### hnspool

**stratum host**: stratum-us.hnspool.com
**stratum_port**: 3001

**username**: hnspool_registered_username
**password**: hnspool_registered_password

<a id="advancedOptions"></a>
## Advanced Options:

**App/API developers**: You can run like ```HANDYRAW=true node mine.js``` or set the environment variable ```HANDYRAW=true``` and the miner executable will output raw JSON. The dashboard application is built using the raw CLI JSON output.

**Multiple Configs!**: If you want to use different worker names or pools with the same miner executable, you can pass in your custom config.json into the miner like:
```node mine.js myCustomConfigName.json```
Note the miner will default to config.json without this argument.

**ASIC per Config**: If you are using multiple configs, you may want to group multiple Goldshell HS1's as you see fit. Within ```goldshell.json``` the line ```asics:"-1"``` can change to: ```asics:"COM1,COM2"```. basically the COM* values are the ports displayed initially when you start the miner with ```node mine.js```


<a id="faq"></a>
## Mining FAQ:

1. I started the dashboard and it says connection to 127.0.0.1 is timed out and trying again in 20s. 

This means your fullnode is not running. Please [launch a fullnode](#runFullnode)  or mine to a pool IP address.

2. No ASICs were detected.

Ensure the blue LED next to the USB port on the HS1 is solid blue. If so, and you're windows, [Download STM32 Virtual COM PORT driver from Goldshell](https://github.com/goldshellminer/HS1/tree/master/miner/serial_driver) so that the ASIC can be detected

3. We do not auto-start the fullnode for you here like we do in HandyMiner-GUI. However we made it easy here and its a [double click to start it](#runFullnode). 

4. Windows may also need to add the following two items added to the ```Path``` environment variable:

```
C:\Program Files\nodejs\node_modules\npm\bin
```
<a id="linuxFAQ"></a>

#### Linux FAQ

If you try to mine out of the box without ```sudo``` you may see an error that looks like:
```
asic connection error:: [Error: Error: Permission denied, cannot open /dev/ttyACM0]
```

If you dont want to run as sudo, you can modify your permissions to the ASIC device like so:

Notice the serial address in the error ^^ : ```/dev/ttyACM0```
On the terminal, we will need to add your user to the group that owns the serial device, then restart the Linux machine.

##### To add your user to the device group for access: 
##### the easy way: ```sudo ./linux_grant_serial_permissions.sh```, and then restart the linux machine.
##### or the less easier way: 
0. Run the command with the device ID listed in the error, like:
```ls -la /dev/ttyACM0```
It will output something like:
```crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 Jul 18 18:06 /dev/ttyACM0```
Which in our case, the group is ```dialout```
1. To add your username to the dialout group:
```sudo useradd -G dialout $USER```
2. Now restart the computer and voila, you can now mine without sudo!

<a id="runFullnode"></a>
### Running an HSD Fullnode for solo mining

There are some handy docker utilities in the folder ```./fullnode_utils``` which you can double click on mac/windows/linux to create, launch, stop or nuke a stratum-enabled fullnode on your local machine that you can mine to. Any utilities specific to the network (main|testnet|simnet) are noted in the command names. 

<a id="dockerReminders"></a>
#### Docker Fullnode Reminders:
1. Make sure you installed docker. PSA: you dont need to login to docker either, dont let them fool you [mac, hunt for the dmg link](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/release-notes/) [windows, hunt for the exe link](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/release-notes/) ). Even after you install it: you dont need to login in order to run this goodness.
2. Make sure that you added your wallet address you'd like paid at to ```run.mac.command OR run.windows.bat OR run.sh (for production)``` or ```run.powng.mac.command OR run.powng.windows.bat OR run.powng.sh (for simnet)``` in the end of the command that looks like: ```"./run.sh hs1qwfpd5ukdwdew7tn7vdgtk0luglgckp3klj44f8"```

#### Docker Fullnode FAQs:

1. I get an error:: ``` Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint earthlabHSD (...) Error starting userland proxy: mkdir /port/tcp:0.0.0.0:14038:tcp:172.17.0.2:14038: input/output error Error: failed to start containers: earthlabHSD ``` 
Right click the docker icon in your taskbar and 'restart docker'. It might take a couple minutes to fully restart.

2. Can I access the hsd docker fullnode? 
Yes. Port 15937 will be open for RPC calls to the node per usual, else ssh into the container's hsd directory with::
```docker exec -it earthlabHSD bash```
Windows:
```winpty docker exec -it earthlabHSD bash```

3. I'd like to import my wallet into this fullnode, How do I set my fullnode's API password and/or stratum password to something more meaningful? 

Edit the file you run the fullnode with, ```run.mac.command``` or ```run.windows.bat``` for example, and add the 3rd and 4th parameters into run.sh like:::
```docker start earthlabHSD && docker exec -i earthlabHSD sh -c "./run.sh hs1qwfpd5ukdwdew7tn7vdgtk0luglgckp3klj44f8 main my_hsd_api_password_here my_stratum_password_here"``` 
and pay attention that the passwords are inside that double quote ^^

4. If you don't want to run a Dockerized fullnode, you can feel free to check the docs in ```fullnode_native_readme.md``` to see how to launch your own native hsd fullnode.
